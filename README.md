# ESP8266-Firebase-AppInventor-IoT
Hi! It's a project to control an LED from a mobile phone. [Here is a detailed guide.](https://medium.com/@emirhankarahan/esp8266-01-firebase-ve-app-inventor-ile-iot-projesi-2ac7f7472a5e) It's not in English but i think that you can figure out from the pictures/videos and a little bit translating.

## Software Setup
1. Install Arduino IDE
2. Install Arduino ESP8266 core
3. Install ArduinoJson library
3. Download FirebaseArduino library
4. Start Arduino
5. Click Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...
6. Choose firebase-arduino-master.zip downloaded in step 3.

## Hardware Setup
I've used an Arduino to program esp8266-01 module but you can use a TLL-USB adaptor as well. I will give my connections as a photo.
