# ESP8266-Firebase-AppInventor-IoT

Hi! It's a project to control an LED from a mobile phone.

## Software Setup

1. Install Arduino IDE
2. Install Arduino ESP8266 core
3. Download FirebaseArduino library
4. Start Arduino
5. Click Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...
6. Choose firebase-arduino-master.zip downloaded in step 4.

## Hardware Setup
I've used an Arduino to program esp8266-01 module but you can use a TLL-USB adaptor as well. I will give my connections as a photo.
